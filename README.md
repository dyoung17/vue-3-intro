This is the Vue 3 Tutorial from the Vue Mastery site. I am currently learning Vue 3 and am using the tutorial from Vue Mastery available at the following link:

The tutorial is meant to acquaint me with some basics of the framework such as Attribute Binding, Conditional and List Rendering, Event Handling, Computed Properties, Components, Props, and V-model.

The application is a single page app the shows available socks that can be added to a cart
